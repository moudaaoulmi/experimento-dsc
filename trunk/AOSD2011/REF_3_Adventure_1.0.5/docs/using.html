<p><a href="http://localhost:8080/ab">http://localhost:8080/ab</a> </p>

ofserver where the J2EE server is running. And also if you had chosen a
different port for the server, you need to replace "8080" in the URL
listed above with the port of your choice. </i></p>
<b> Browsing the Consumer Web Site And Choosing an Adventure</b>
<p> The home page of the Consumer Web site gives an array of choices
for different
categories of available adventures. Clicking these major categories of
adventures
displays the specific adventure packages available for the chosen
category.
Each adventure is pre-packaged meaing that each has a default set of
lodging
and activities. Click the adventure package of interest to display the
details
of the adventure along with the default lodging and activities
available
with the package. </p>
<p> Click the link "Purchase Package" to go to a Web page where you are
asked to enter package details such as the number of people, number of
days, start date, and number of rooms. Once you choose these details
and click "Continue" a subsequent page lets you specify the city of
origin and choose the mode of transport to the adventure locale. If you
plan to arrange
your own transportation, you may do so in this same page. You may also
choose from a set of available flights. </p>
<b> Changing Cart Contents</b>
<p> When you complete the above steps, you see a summary of the package
you have chosen. You can either make more changes (using the links
provided) or choose to confirm the purchase of the adventure package.
The Web site
allows you to change the number of nights lodging, the number of people
per activity, and the type of lodging, activity, and transportation
mode. If
you want to change the number of people or number of days, choose the
appropriate fields in the "Summary" screen and click the "update"
button. If you want to change the Lodging / Activities / Transportation
details, you may do so using the appropriate links provided. </p>
<b> Booking Your Vacation</b>
<p> Once you have finalized the contents of your adventure package,
book your vacation by clicking the "Checkout" link. Clicking this link
places your reservation for confirmation with the Order Processing
(OPC) component. If you have not yet signed in, you will first have to
sign in (and possibly create a new account) before placing your
reservation for confirmation with the OPC. When you place your
reservation, you get an order id for your reference. </p>
<b>Tracking Order Status</b>
<p> Track the status of your order by clicking the "Track Order" Link
on the top left of the page and entering the order ID.</p>
<b> Sign in or Create New Account</b>
<p> To sign in as an existing user or create a new user account, click
the "Account" link available at the top left corner of your browser
window. You can either sign in (if you already have an account) or
create a new account (in which case, you will be asked to enter some
identifying information). </p>
