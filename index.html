<p>
If you download the <b>Sun Java System Application Server 8.1 2005Q1 bundle</b>, Quickstart will be the
only sample available.
The <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/index.html"><b>J2EE(TM) 1.4&nbsp;Tutorial</b></a>
is available for download from the J2EE web site. The <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints"><b>J2EE(TM)
 1.4 BluePrints </b></a> are available in three bundles:
 <ul>
<li>J2EE 1.4 SDK bundle
<li>Sun Java System Application Server 8.1 2005Q1 samples bundle
<li>Separate download from the J2EE web site
</ul>

The Sun Java System Application Server 8.1 2005Q1 does not include the J2EE 1.4 BluePrints.
To install the J2EE 1.4 BluePrints, download and unzip them into the installation
directory of the Application Server. Otherwise, if you have downloaded
and installed <b>J2EE 1.4 SDK</b>, your installation will
contain the J2EE(TM) 1.4 BluePrints samples.
<p>The J2EE 1.4 Tutorial is not part of the J2EE(TM) 1.4 SDK bundle.

<p><b>Samples Index</b> </p>
          
      <p>A complete <b><a href="docs/list.html">list of sample applications</a></b> is included
 with the application server. </p>
 <p><b>Quick Start</b></p>
                                               
      <p>Before working with the samples, ensure that you've followed the 
  Quick          Start Guide in order to familiarize yourself with the features 
  and basic          operation of the application server. The Quick Start 
Guide  is available          at <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;install_dir&gt;/docs/QuickStart.html
            </font><br>
               <b><br>
               Before Working With Samples</b>        </p>
                                               
 In addition to following the Quick Start Guide, review the following sections before working  with
the sample applications.
                          
        <p><b><a name="setup-env"></a>1. Set Up Your Environment</b> <br>
                 Before deploying sample applications to Application Server,
              ensure your application server environment is functioning properly.
              The basic operations introduced in the Quick Start Guide will
   help            ensure that your environment is configured properly. A
key   requirement            prior to working with the samples is to ensure
that   the following directory            is added to your PATH environment
variable:            </p>
                                                           
<blockquote>
    <code>&lt;install_dir&gt;/bin</code>
</blockquote>
                                                                     
        <p>If you are either sharing your application server installation
   with            other users or using a user ID that does not have write
 permissions             to the area in which the application server is installed
 (for example,            a non root user using an application server installed
  under <code>/usr/appserver</code>on Solaris[tm] 9), you should make a copy of the
  sample applications in your own directory before working with the     
      samples. For more information on creating your own samples environment,
             see <a href="docs/setupenv.html"><b>Creating Your
 Own Samples            Environment</b></a>.         </p>
                                                           
        <p><b><a name="directory-structure"></a>2. Review Samples Directory
   Structure</b>            <br>
                 The sample applications included in the application server 
 installation             are packaged according to a consistent structure. 
 Each sample's  directory            structure represents a typical source 
 code directory  structure layout.            For more information on the 
manner in which the samples are organized,            see <b><a
 href="docs/packaging.html">Samples Directory Structure</a></b>.        
         </p>
                                                           
        <p><b><a name="using-ant"></a>3. Review Using Ant with the Samples</b>
              <br>
                 All of the samples include <font
 face="Courier New, Courier, mono">build.xml</font>            files that
   enable you to use the Java[tm]-based Ant build facility to           
easily    recompile, reassemble and redeploy the sample applications. For
           more information on using Ant with the samples, see
        <b><a href="docs/ant.html">Using            Ant with the Samples</a></b>.
         </p>
                                                           
        <p><b><a name="using-pointbase"></a>4. Review Using PointBase with
   the            Samples</b> <br>
                 When the PointBase database server is installed as part
of  the  application            server installation, the database server
includes   a prepopulated database            containing the tables and data
required   by the sample applications.            For more information on
how to use   PointBase with the samples, see <b><a
 href="docs/pointbase.html">Using PointBase with the Samples</a></b>.   
        This section also addresses how to download, install and configure
   the            PointBase server when you are using the application server
   that is installed            as part of a Solaris 9 installation.  It also addresses how to configure Pointbase server when using it as part of Sun Java System Enterprise Edition 8.1 2005Q1.   
     </p>
                                                           
        <p><b><a name="using-oracle"></a>5. Review Using Oracle with the
Samples</b>            <br>
                 The samples which require databaseconnections can also work
  with            an Oracle RDBMS. For more information on how to use an
Oracle   RDBMS            with the samples, see  <b><a
 href="docs/oracle.html">Using            Oracle with the Samples</a></b>.
        </p>

        <p><a name="pre-built"></a><b>6. Rebuild pre-built applications</b><br>
        Pre-built applications are bundled with each
example, so you can deploy the application without first having to rebuild
it.  However, if you plan to modify the source code and rebuild the application
using <tt>asant core</tt>, the bundled pre-built application
is no longer used when deploying the application, the rebuilt application is
used for deployment instead.  This rebuilt sample will be built in the assemble/ directory
to avoid overwriting the original application and will ensure that the newly
generated application (not the application that is originally bundled) is
used for deployment.
   </p>
                                                 
 <p><b><a name="samples-domain"></a></b><b>7. Samples domain with pre-deployed applications</b><br>
  During installation you had the option of creating the samples
  administrative domain, which includes pre-deployed applications.
  You can see a list of these applications by running the 
  asadmin list command or the Admin Console.
  To start the Admin Console for the samples domain, in a browser
  go to the following URL, replacing &lt;<tt>hostname</tt>&gt; with either localhost
  or the name of the remote host running the application server.
  The default port number for the admin server of the samples domain
  is 4858.
</P
<pre>
  http://&lt;<tt>hostname</tt>&gt;:4858/asadmin
</pre>
<p>See the <a href="./indexSamplesDomain.html">Pre-Deployed Samples Index</a> for further details on
 pre-deployed samples.

        <p><b><a name="replacing"></a></b><b>8. Replace <tt>localhost</tt> and <tt>&lt;admin.port&gt;</tt></b><br>
To start the Admin Console, enter URL <code>http://localhost:&lt;admin.port&gt;/asadmin</code> in a browser, <br>
replacing <tt>localhost</tt> with the name of the host where your application
server is installed and replacing <tt>&lt;admin.port&gt;</tt> with the value of key <tt>admin.port</tt> which is located in file <tt>&lt;install_dir&gt;/samples/common.properties</tt>.
For Sun Java System Application Server Platform Edition 8.1 2005Q1, the default URL of the Admin Console is <code>http://localhost:4848/asadmin</code>.
For Sun Java System Application Server Enterprise Edition 8.1 2005Q1, the default URL of the Admin Console is <code>https://localhost:4849/asadmin</code><br>
</p>
<p><b><a name="enterprise"></a></b><b>9. Enterprise Edition</b><br>
The samples in <tt>&lt;install_dir&gt;/samples/ee-samples</tt>
demonstrate some capabilities of the SJAS Enterprise Edition.
Note: These samples are not included in the Platform Edition.
The other samples will deploy on the Domain Administration Server only.
Before deploying the Enterprise Edition samples, please read the information in
<code>&lt;install_dir&gt;/samples/ee-samples/ee-setup.html</code>.
</p>

<p><b><a name="jes"></a></b><b>10. Configuring samples for use with Java Enterprise System</b><br>
Before proceeding with executing the sample applications on an instance of Sun Java System Application Server 8.1 that was installed as part of JES, make sure to specify the location of the Sun Java System Message Queue (MQ) messaging software by setting up the following properties in <code>&lt;install_dir&gt;/samples/common.properties</code>:
<ul>
<li>com.sun.aas.imqInstallDir</li>
<li>com.sun.aas.imqHome</li>
<li>com.sun.aas.imqLib</li>
<li>com.sun.aas.imqUserMgr</li>
</ul>

To set the above properties open the <code>&lt;install_dir&gt;/config/asenv.conf</code> or <code>&lt;install_dir&gt;/config/asenv.bat</code> file. Note down the values of <code>AS_IMQ_LIB</code> and <code>AS_IMQ_BIN</code>. 
<br><br>
Now set <code>com.sun.aas.imqLib</code> to the value of <code>&lt;AS_IMQ_LIB&gt;</code>.<br>Set <code>com.sun.aas.imqHome</code> to <code>${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/domains/${domain.name}/imq</code>.<br>Set <code>com.sun.aas.imqUserMgr</code> to the value of <code>&lt;AS_IMQ_BIN&gt;/imqusermgr</code><br>Set <code>com.sun.aas.imqInstallDir</code> to <code>${com.sun.aas.imqLib}/../</code>
