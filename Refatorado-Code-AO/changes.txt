After installation of this plugin eclipse must be restarted with the -clean option at least once.
That is: <path-to-my-eclipse-install>/eclipse.exe -clean

The plugin version 4.x.x does not support eclipse 2.x.x any more. 
Make sure you got an eclipse 3.0 or higher installation you are installing this plugin to.

Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin v4.2.0
----------------------------------------------
This release concentrates on extending the quickfix functionality, 
which was rudimetarily introduced in version 4.1.0.
A new context menu action ('Apply Checkstyle fixes') was added to the Java editor and other views
(e.g. Package Explorer) which - when invoked - tries to apply all exiting quickfixes to 
the Checkstyle violations in the selected file.

Additionaly new quickfixes were implemented for the following Checkstyle checks:
FinalLocalVariable
StringLiteralEquality
FinalClass
ArrayTypeStyle
UncommentedMain
UpperEll
ModifierOrder

Apart from that a few bugs were fixed as well as features implemented.

Please note the new Voting section in the Checkstyle plugins preferences.
If you like to tell us your opinion about the plugin please use this to cast your vote.

We've given the plugin a test run on Eclipse 3.3M4 with no obvious problems, so it can be
expected to run on the Eclipse 3.3 Milestones.

Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin v4.1.0 final
----------------------------------------------
Final release of Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin 4.1.0.
Uses the recently released Checkstyle 4.2.

Bugs:
1504122  Violations tab column widths

Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin v4.0.93 (4.1.0 beta4)
----------------------------------------------

Minor bugfix release. Uses a new snapshot from Checkstyle CVS head.

Bugs:
1464012  Fixed ProjectClassLoader issue
1466967  Violations tab and closed project  
1487954  Eclipse 3.2RC4 doesn't find any updates  
1478288  "Invalid thread access" when Checkstyle run. 


Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin v4.0.92 (4.1.0 beta3)
----------------------------------------------

Sports a recent Checkstyle build from Checkstyle Head stream (2006/03/24).
The Statistics Plugin now supports saving reports (in rtf format) from the Statistics views.

We also started on implementing a quickfix feature. Using these you can fix some checkstyle warnings
very easy - similar to quickfixes the Eclipse Java Editor offers.
Currently quickfixes are implemented for the following Checkstyle checks:
NeedBraces
DefaultComesLast
EmptyStatement
MissingSwitchDefault
DesignForExtension
FinalParameters
RedundantModifier

IMPORTANT:
Please note that this new feature is to be considered experimental 
- so be sure you archived your sources before applying those quickfixes.
All changes made by quickfixes should be undoable in the editor though 
- so serious problems are not expected.

Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin v4.0.90 (4.1.0 beta)
----------------------------------------------

Version 4.1.0 introduces the "local configuration" scheme which allows to set up check configurations private to a project.
The check configuration data will be stored inside the projects .checkstyle file.
This allows for a true self contained Checkstyle setup for projects, further enhancing teamworking support as
no additional setup in the developers workspace is required.
At the same time the well known "per workspace" setup of Checkstyle configurations (now called "global configurations")
remains intact, allowing for set up of check configurations that can be used by multiple project.

There are now new ways to resolve properties within Checkstyle configuration files:
 * properties can be resolved from Classpath variables
 * properties can be resolved from System/Environment properties (passed into eclipse via the -D paramter)
 * Reintroduced in 4.1.0 is that you can input properties as you set up the configuration. The plugin will find
   unresolved properties and asks for you to input the values.
   
The way Project relative configurations work has changed a bit. Now they are relative to exactly one project
instead of possibly multiple projects. This achieves a more expectable behaviour and allows new configuration
deployment schemes, for instance to use a configuration file that lies relative to another project in the 
workspace.

The internal Checkstyle logging (error log) was bridged with the Eclipse Error Log.
This way exceptions thrown by Checkstyle checks (standard or custom) appear in the Error Log View.
This greatly enhances debugging of custom checks used with the plugin.

Version 4.1.0 now directly contains the new Statistics plugin addition which adds 2 views to Eclipse which make handling of large amounts of Checkstyle violations very much easier.

A lot of other features have been implemented and bugs been resolved, as you can judge from the list below:
