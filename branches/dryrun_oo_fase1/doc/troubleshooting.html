        <h2>-- Troubleshooting --</h2>
        <p>A lot of effort has gone into testing the Checkstyle plug-in, but like all software
            things can and do go wrong. The following are some tips that may help in troubleshooting
            when things go wrong and some guidelines on reporting bugs to help get them fixed.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Check the Eclipse Error Log view. All exceptions happening in Eclipse should be
                    logged there. Identify the log entry which you mean belongs to your problem with
                    the Checkstyle plug-in. The exception message and the stack trace might give you
                    an additional clue what went wrong.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Verify that the .checkstyle file in the project&#39;s root directory is
                    writable when editing the project&#39;s settings. Some version control
                    systems don&#39;t know to make this file writable and the plug-in may fail
                    trying to write your updated settings to it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Verify that the Check Configuration referred to in your project configuration
                    exists in your workspace. Because the .checkstyle file is often shared through a
                    team repository its possible for the file to be updated by one team member and
                    propagated to another team member when he synchronizes with the repository. The
                    Check Configuration name in the File Set must match one of the Check
                    Configurations defined in your workspace.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>-- Reporting Bugs --</h2>
        <p>Bugs do happen. If you think you have found a bug with the Checkstyle plug-in please
            report it on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">SourceForge
                Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in project site</a>. Please submit as much of the following

                with, which operation system </li>
            <li>Steps for recreating the problem </li>
            <li>The .checkstyle from the project experiencing the problem </li>
            <li>The Checkstyle configuration file in question </li>
            <li>The stack trace from the corresponding error in the Eclipse error log view </li>
            <li>Specific Java source files experiencing the problem, if possible </li>
        </ul>
