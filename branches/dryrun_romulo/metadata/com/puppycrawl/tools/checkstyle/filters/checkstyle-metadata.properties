SuppressionCommentFilter.desc             = Filter <code>SuppressionCommentFilter</code> uses pairs of comments to suppress audit events.<br/>\r\nRationale: Sometimes there are legitimate reasons for violating a check. When this is a matter of the code in question and not personal preference, the best place to override the policy is in the code itself. Semi-structured comments can be associated with the check. This is sometimes superior to a separate suppressions file, which must be kept up-to-date as the source file is edited.
