        <p>There are only a few things you need to do to get up and running using the Checkstyle
            plug-in. The first thing is to understand a few basic concepts about how the plug-in
            works.</p>
        <p><b>Basic Concepts <br/>
            </b> The Checkstyle Plug-in uses a project builder to check your project files with
            Checkstyle. So whenever you build your project your files will be checked by Checkstyle
            as well. <br/> This goes so far that even if you edit a single file in your Eclipse
            editor this file will immediately get checked by Checkstyle on file save (assuming the
            Eclipse auto-build feature is enabled) - giving you immediate feedback about the changes
            you made. <br/> To use a simple analogy - the Checkstyle Plug-in works very much like a
            compiler but instead of producing <i>.class</i> files it produces warnings where your
            code violates the Checkstyle rules. <br/> The violations Checkstyle finds in your code
            are accessible in the Eclipse Problems View and are additionally annotated in the code
            editor.</p>
        <p>The set of rules used to check your code is not fixed but highly configurable. <br/> A
            Check Configuration specifies which check rules you want to inspect your code, the
            configuration settings for each rule, and the severity level of the message if the rule
            finds a problem. <br/> Once defined a Check Configuration can be used across multiple
            projects. The Checkstyle Plug-in comes with one Check Configuration already defined.
            <br/> You can create own Check Configurations using the comfortable Check Configuration
            Editor that comes with the plug-in or even use an existing Checkstyle Configuration file
            from an external location.</p>
