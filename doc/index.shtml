        <title>The Checkstyle Plug-in for Eclipse</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>-- Introduction --</h2>
        <p> The eclipse-cs Checkstyle plug-in integrates the well-known source code analyzer
            Checkstyle into today's leading IDE - Eclipse.<br/>
            <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> is a development tool
            written by Oliver Burn to help you ensure that your Java code adheres to a set of coding
            standards. Checkstyle does this by inspecting your Java source code and pointing out
            items that deviate from a defined set of coding rules. The full Checkstyle distribution
            is included with the Checkstyle plug-in. In addition to using the Eclipse Checkstyle
            plug-in you can also use Checkstyle from the command line or as part of an Ant build.
            For more information about using Checkstyle outside of Eclipse see the <a
                href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle documentation</a>.</p>
        <p>With the Checkstyle Eclipse plug-in your code is constantly inspected for problems.
            Within the Eclipse workbench you are notified of problems via the Eclipse Problems View
            and source code annotations just as you would see with compiler errors or warnings.</p>

        <h2>-- Download &amp; Installation --</h2>
        <p>The first way to install the Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in is via the <a
                href="http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/update/">update site</a>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Within Eclipse go to <strong>
                    <em>Help-&gt;Software Updates-&gt;Find and Install</em>
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li> Choose <strong>
                    <em>Search for new features to install</em>
                </strong> and press <strong>
                    <em>Next</em>
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li> Create a <strong>
                    <em>New Remote Site...</em>
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li> Input a name to your liking (for instance <i>Checkstyle Plug-in</i>) and input the
                following URL: <span class="code-blue"
                >http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/update</span>
            </li>
            <li> Click your way through the following pages to install the plug-in. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternatively the Checkstyle Eclipse Plug-in can be downloaded from the <a
                href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in's
                SourceForge project page</a>. The download package consists of a single zip file
            that contains both the Checkstyle Plug-in and the Checkstyle core engine.</p>
        <p>Once you have downloaded the distribution zip file extract its contents. First, exit from
            Eclipse. Next, copy the <span class="code-blue"
                    >com.atlassw.tools.eclipse.checkstyle_<b>&lt;version&gt;</b></span>
            folder to your Eclipse plug-in folder and restart Eclipse. That's all there is to it,
            you are now ready to run Checkstyle.</p>
        <p>
            <b>
                <i>Important Note:</i>
            </b>If you did not use the update site to install the plug-in please make sure to
            restart Eclipse with the <span class="code-blue">-clean</span> option at least once.
            This is because Eclipse caches a lot of information about plug-ins. In case you just
            updated the plug-in from a previous version this information cached by Eclipse is not up
            to date - resulting in the plug-in failing with ClassNotFoundExceptions and other
            serious issues.</p>
        <p>
            <b>
                <i>Important Note:</i>
            </b>As of plug-in release 4.0.0 only Eclipse 3.0 and newer is supported. Eclipse 2.x.x
            support is discontinued. Please use older plug-in versions with Eclipse 2.x.x. -
            downloadable from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipse-cs/">SourceForge
                Project Page</a>
        </p>
        <h2>-- Support this project --</h2>
        <p>Developing and testing all the nifty features you see in the plug-in takes a considerable
            amount of time. <br/> This project is developed by its team members purely in their free
            time - so we're not in for the money but the fun.</p>
        <p>However, if you are using the Checkstyle Plug-in in your production environment you are
            probably saving a lot of money because of the increased code quality that the plug-in
            helps you to enforce. <br/> So if you really like this plug-in you might want to
            consider a donation for the Checkstyle Plug-in Project. <br/> Donations can my made via
            PayPal ranging from $5 to $250. More info about donating to this project can be found <a
                href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=80344">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Thank you! <br/> The Checkstyle Plug-in dev team</p>
