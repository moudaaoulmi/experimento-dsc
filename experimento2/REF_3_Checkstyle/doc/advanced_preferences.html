		<h2>-- Advanced Preference Settings --</h2>
		<p>This page finally explaings the meaning of the other preferences on the plugins
			preference page.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><b>Rebuild projects if needed</b><br/> Determines the plugins behaviour when a
					configuration is changed via the configuration editor. This option can be set to
					automatically rebuild the affected projects, never to rebuild these projects or
					to ask wether to rebuild.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>Warn before losing configured file sets</b><br/> Set if the plugin should warn
					you when you are about to lose configured file sets in the project properties.
					This can happen if you switch from an advanced project configuration using file
					sets to the simple setting.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>Include rule names in violation messages</b><br/> Set if the name of the
					Checkstyle module that produced the warning should be prepended to the message
					of this warning. This way you can sort the problems via the Problems View
					alphabetically and group the warnings together.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>Limit Checkstyle markers per resource to</b><br/> Use this to limit the
					maximum amount of markers reported for a single file.<br/> Reason is that a
					massive amount of markers (>10000) can seriously bog down your Eclipse.<br/> Use
					this setting if you are experiencing such troubles.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b>Disable project classloader</b><br/> Users running the Eclipse Checkstyle
					Plug-in on RAD 6.0 might experience workspace crashes when using particular
					Checkstyle checks (type aware checks like RedundantThrows).<br/> The source of
					these problems is a bug in the J9 JVM on which RAD 6.0 runs.<br/> If you are
					experiencing this problem enabling this option will help you.<br/> Please note
					that diabling the project classloader might introduce false negatives/positives
					for such type aware checks (currently only RedundantThrows and
				JavadocMethod).</p>
