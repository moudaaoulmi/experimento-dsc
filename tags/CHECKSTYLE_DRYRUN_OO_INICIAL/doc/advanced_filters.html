        <h2>-- Using the plug-in filters --</h2>
        <p>The Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in contains a filter facility that uses filters to exclude
            certain files from checking. <br/> Knowing that the plug-in allows you to configure file
            sets you might ask why there are also filters. <br/> This feature seems to be quite
            redundant to file sets.</p>
        <p>Lets think about this some more. <br/> File set let you configure patterns that determine
            if a file gets included or excluded from the checks based on the file name. <br/> In
            some situations this is quite sufficient but there are also cases where you want to
            exclude files based on other properties, for instance if you want to exclude files that
            are write protected. <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <p>The filters are accessible in the bottom section of the Checkstyle Project Properties
            Page.</p>
        <p><img src="images/properties_simple_checked.png" alt="Plug-in filters"/>
            <br/> To enable a filter for your project just select the corresponding check box. <br/>
            Some filters are configurable, if you select such a filter the <i>Change...</i> button
            will become enabled. <br/> Pressing the <i>Change...</i> button will open a specific
            filter editor.</p>
        <p>The following filters come with the Checkstyle Plug-in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>File types filter</b>
                    <br/> At the top of the list of filters is the File types filter. This filter
                    exludes all files which file type is not included in the configured set. Per
                    default setting only .java files pass this filter. <br/> One might rightfully
                    ask why this filter exists where you can achieve the very same using <a
                        href="advanced_file_sets.html">file sets</a>. The answer is simple:
                    performance. <br/> Consider you are using the Checkstyle Plugin with a project
                    that contains several 10,000 files. Using only file sets all files (the full
                    project relative path) of the project would be checked against possibly multiple
                    regular expressions. The worst case is that 100,000 or more regular expression
                    checks would be executed to determine if a file needs to be checked or not.
                    <br/> In comparison the file types filter performs a simple String comparison
                    with the file ending of each file - this way the amount of files that need to be
                    checked against the file set are rapidly reduced. <br/> For this very reason
                    this filter cannot be disabled. <br/> In most cases you won't need to change the
                    settings of this filter. If your java files don't have the standard .java file
                    type or you are using the Checkstyle plugin with Checkstyle extensions for other
                    languages (for instance <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/checkstyle4ada"
                        >Checkstyle4Ada</a>) you can add more file types that need to pass this
                    filter by pressing the <i>Change...</i> button.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Filter for write protected files</b>
                    <br/> Use this filter if you want to check only writeable files. This filter is
                    particular useful if you use a versioning system with a Check-In/Check-Out
                    semantic which uses file write protection to allow/disallow modification. <br/>
                    So you can restrict the Checkstyle Plug-in to only check files you are actually
                    working on (because you checked them out from the repository).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Filter for files that are not opened in an Eclipse editor</b>
                    <br/> You can use this filter to check only files you opened in an Eclipse
                    editor.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Filter for files from specific packages</b>
                    <br/> This is a configurable filter, allowing you to specify the packages you
                    want to exclude from checking. You can, of course, get the same result by <a
                        href="advanced_file_sets.html">configuring file sets</a> .</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Filter for files from non source directories</b>
                    <br/> Some projects have java sources outside of source folders (for instance
                    build folders where all sources are copied to for source distribution builds).
                    <br/> With this filter you can exclude this files from the checks. Again, this
                    can be also achieved by <a href="advanced_file_sets.html">configuring file
                    sets</a> - but for most cases the filter is easier to use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Filter that excludes all files that are in sync with the CVS repository</b>
                    <br/> If your project is based on a CVS repository you might want to use this
                    filter. <br/> With this you can limit the checks to the files you actually
                    changed. All other files that are in sync with the repository (therefore
                    unchanged) are excluded from the checks.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Eclipse Checkstyle Plug-in filters are base on some very simple interfaces - so the
            filter facility is very much extensible. <br/> The plug-in provides an extension point
            for filters that can be used to provide your custom filter. Read <a
